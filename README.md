# floodRiskManagement
This paper examines the application of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for flood risk management, focusing on the varying impact and response required at different flood risk levels. The modelâ€™s simulations across low, moderate, and high flood risk levels provide critical insights into flood spread, water levels, human evacuation, and property damage. At low risk levels, the flood impact is minimal and manageable, with limited property damage and minimal disruption to daily life. Moderate risk scenarios entail substantial property damage and more complex evacuations, while high-risk scenarios reveal severe flooding, extensive property damage, and prolonged evacuation times. The study emphasizes the necessity of ongoing monitoring, environmental considerations, comprehensive evacuation plans, and robust flood defenses to mitigate damage and loss of life in high-risk flood areas.

This is show our flood risk management agent base modeling analysis using odd protocol and simulated by use AnyLogic, NetLogo softwares. And this repository is add those code files.
